        This adventure begins on a frigid morning. We&#8217;ve run out of coffee
        beans, but leaving our office means venturing into certain peril.
        Yesterday, a colony of ravenous Wolpertingers descended from the
        foothills. No one can find the defensive operations manual, and our
        security experts are on an off-the-grid team-building retreat in
        Katchanga.
